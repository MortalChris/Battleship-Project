Gameboard stuff
1-Need to grab the length of each ship and display it on the board.
    -Allow you to place ships on the board and turn it horizontal or vertical
    -randomize ai placement

2-Turn based back and forth
    -Have Ai oppponent
    -If player scores a hit it will keep being the same persons turn

3-When A part of the ship gets hit then it does hit() function which adds 1 dmg
    -Also need a think to stop the same button from being pressed
    -Display (eithor or) on hit visual/text for ships
        -when dmg = 5 then it will run isSunk() which will eventually add points
            -If the points reach a certain max then it will trigger gameover
